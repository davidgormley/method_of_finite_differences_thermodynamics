To run this project you will need to have MATLAB installed on your computer. The version I used for this project was R2016b.

## Usage

To use this prject, you will need to download all the files and first run the Crank Nicolson fucntion which will call Gauss Seidel. The output, Z, will then be inputted into the create animation function. This will start visualising the heat transfer.

## Contributing

Further contribution to this project is unnecessary.
